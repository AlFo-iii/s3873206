  <h4 style="color:slateblue;"><strong>Personal Information</strong></h4>

  <p>Hey as you may of already read a couple times my name is Alan Fogel,
     I‚Äôm a 20 year old male from a little old suburb called Caulfield.
     I‚Äôve lived in the same house my whole life, however, my older sister and
     parents bounced between a few houses for about 7 years until I was born
     when they settled with the home I‚Äôve been raised in. My parents fled an
     authoritarian and communist Belarus (at the time still in the Soviet Union)
     giving up all their possessions to seek a better life out here.</p>

  <p>My parents have been a massive influence on me, they instilled a very
     European mindset onto me.A big example of this would be the time I came
     home from School in Prep and told my Dad ‚ÄúI want to play AFL‚Äù,
     he straight away took me to the park and played football with me but with a
     round ball‚Ä¶ since that point I‚Äôve been playing soccer my whole life, it‚Äôs
     one of my biggest joys and passions in life and it was always my dream job
     as a kid.</p>

  <p>I competed and trained at a fairly high level for my club and tended to have
     fun against lesser opponents for both my high school teams; Bialik College
     and John Monash Science School.</p>

  <p>A fact that not many people know about me is that I had a SAT Math score in
     the top <b>1 percentile</b> and subsequently got to the first step of MIT
     interviews as I had interest from the Soccer coach to be in his program, but
     I was quickly discarded due to the fact my English wasn‚Äôt as impressive at
     all and my school transcripts were crap. So in reality I probably had
     absolutely no chance to get an offer, nevertheless I think that it‚Äôs still
     cool to be somewhat acknowledged by <b>MIT!</b></p>
  <br>

  <h4 style="color:slateblue;">Interest in IT</h4>

  <p>To be honest it‚Äôs really difficult to pinpoint what event sparked my interest
     in IT, I think it‚Äôs more of a culmination of events that have led me to this
     point. My Mum always thrust me into school holiday programs that had; coding,
     robotics and game design, in combination with my Myers-Briggs personality
     type I think it‚Äôs pretty fair enough that I‚Äòve ended up here.
     (I‚Äôll touch more into that later üòâ)</p>

  <p>I chose RMIT because it seems to be very progressive and has a innovative
     campus that is relatively close to me (Which thanks to spicy cough I
     haven‚Äôt accessed yet). Also <b>[Beep]</b> <i>Monash</i>,
     I spent 4 years of high school there, <b>out of the question!</b> >:[</p>

  <p>The things I expect to learn during my studies is a nuanced way of thinking
     that would be useful in the career path that I choose,
     hopefully distinguishing me from others. I feel like one of my biggest
     strengths is being extremely creative in how I approach issues to solve,
     and I‚Äôd hope synergising this with what
     I learn at RMIT would make me a beast.</p>
  <br>

  <h4 style="color:slateblue;">Ideal Job</h4>
  <img src="IdealJob-Ad.png" alt="Ideal Job" width="450" height="170">
  <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53143220?type=promoted#searchRequestToken
     =f93a2a33-0dcf-4240-8a17-d7e660b5c532">Full Stack Software Engineer</a>

  <p>The positions listed is looking for an experienced and adept software
     engineer. This position is appealing to me for the future as it seems like a
     type of environment where it might feel like a project opposed to a
     job-per-say. I say this in terms of working at a small firm/company and
     being there for its growth, I know I have no experience in the industry
     yet, but I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs more possible to rise the ranks in smaller ‚Äúup and
     coming‚Äù companies in comparison to established goliaths. Plus, I feel like
     $100k 1-4 years after university is feasible and
     pleasing to the bank balance.</p>

  <p>The required skills/experience for this position are experience/knowledge
     in <b>Full Stack</b> and programming languages such as Scala, OCaml as well
     as adept knowledge of general design and software architecture practices.
     Even though the ad for this position doesn‚Äôt specifically state how many
     years‚Äô experience is needed, it can be inferred that they are looking for
     an experienced and skilled engineer who demonstrates the ability to work in
     teams and specifically gel with fields outside one‚Äôs knowledge.</p>

  <p>I currently don‚Äôt have any accolades of qualifications that I can flex
     apart from the most rudimentary IT knowledge from 3 weeks of learning,
     but I definitely do intend to change that. I plan to learn everything
     I can that‚Äôs provided in the course (may need to transfer to something
     that‚Äôs more geared towards Software Eng) and as the IT world is somewhat
     exponentially evolving, during/after my formal education I will
     continue to read and do small courses to sustain my lust for growth
     and knowledge.</p>

  <p>I want to continue in the Bachelor of IT and demonstrate a good standard
     of results, In the future I intend to transfer to Software Engineering
     or Computer Science. If that indeed happens, I want to try sustaining HD
     grades and apply for internships in Year 2 or 3 for that ever so
     important <i>EXP</i>. On completion of my undergraduate degree, whichever it
     may be, I intend to do the Master of Cyber Security as I feel as that is a
     lucrative and in demand field. This is my general outline for my future,
     of course in terms of this job listing I would pursue education In Software
     Engineering, but as this type of job may or may not be available when
     I‚Äôm ready to join the workforce, I must keep my options open in the
     meantime and not fly down one alleyway too early. I still have a lot of
     hard work ahead of me and a lot of learning to do about the career and
     about myself.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>Myers-Briggs test</h5>
  <p>I‚Äôve done the Myers-Briggs test at least 10 times as my response might
    vary day to day (I first started doing them 2 years ago), 8 of which
    resulting in Logician ISTP-A and twice resulting in Logician INTP-A.
    The ISTP-A result is eerily like me and always evokes a feeling of
    being watched every time I read it as I feel it describes me better
    than I could ever. It perfectly describes my love for tinkering with
    things, which is what I‚Äôve always carried with messing around and fixing
    hardware/software. Virtuoso and Logician are very similar, but the key
    distinction is that Logicians tend to be more existential and emotional
    towards their everyday, which I don‚Äôt particularly think I am.</p>
  <img src="istp-virtuoso.png" alt="My personality" width="290" height="345">

  <h5>Online learning style test</h5>
  <p>My result was that I am predominantly a tactile learner and interestingly
    falls in accordance with my Myers-Briggs results of Virtuoso. I also
    hypothesize that this Is why I carry such heavy distaste towards online
    learning as it doesn‚Äôt aid me at all and may sometimes feel like a
    hinderance.</p>
  <img src="learn-type.png" alt="Learning style">

  <h5>Psychopath online test</h5>
  <p>I am happy that I didn‚Äôt rank too high as I think that having some level
    of compassion and morality is important for working in teams and in
    projects that could effect the world to various degrees.</P>
  <img src="Psycho-no.png" alt="Psycho" width="700" height="345">

  <p>To mix it all together, I am an extremely logic centred person who needs
    to be involved to feel truly passionate about a project or assignment.
    I don‚Äôt crave power or leadership positions as I am a tad shy, but I
    know from past events (Captain of soccer teams and schoolhouse captain),
    when I‚Äôm passionate about something I am an extremely uplifting and
    effective leader. I can be a tad selfish, and results driven, as shown
    by my Myers-Briggs results, but if managed I can be an amazing part of
    team as I am able to synergise with any type of team member and bring
    the best out of myself as well as my team-members without it being an
    authoritarian.</p>
  <br>

  <h2 style="color:tomato;">Project Idea: The Public lockers</h2>

  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>I aim to create convenient and affordable lockers for public parks and
    national parks that don‚Äôt require a physical key or separate NFC readers to
    operate them. These lockers would require a specific app that can set up
    and hire out certain lockers for set amounts of time. Freeing people from
    worrying about their own clutter.</p>
  <br>

  <h4>Motivation</h4>
  <p>At the start of lockdown in 2020 all my trainings were cancelled; I went
    from training 4-5 times a week to none. I did enjoy playing games and
    watching Netflix for about 2 weeks straight, but I realised that I had
    to get back to work. I decided to go to the park with a workout plan to
    stay fit and ready, hoping the spiciest of all coughs would just be a
    simple lemon and herb level. I planned to do 2 laps of around 2.7kms,
    skipping rope, a couple cones and a soccer ball to keep my ball skills
    in check. That means I had to bring, running shoes, water bottle,
    earphones, phone, soccer boots, cones, skipping rope, ball and maybe even
    more‚Ä¶ Now this is an exhaustive list, and I had the question ‚ÄúWhere on
    God‚Äôs green Earth am I going to put all this crap?!‚Äù. I live a 5-10 walk
    minutes away from 3 big parks, I‚Äôm not going to drive 2 minutes with gear
    I can carry in one bag comfortably, but then again, I‚Äôm not leaving my bag
    of valuables in some random nook in the park whilst I run or work out with
    no assurances.</p>

  <p>So, I thought of this idea to help those people, like me, who go to parks
    to work out and bring valuables or a large quantity of items that can‚Äôt be
    looked after whilst in ‚Äúsession‚Äù. I understand that the idea is niche and
    very situational, but I believe it still has its use for people.
  <br>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>The lockers act like the lockers in public pools and changing rooms at
    sport centres, but far more secure and catered to the outdoors. These
    lockers would be made of predominantly metals that are able to survive
    the blistering summers, and harsh winter winds of the everchanging
    Victorian climate. In addition to being more resilient compared to the
    notorious fickle wooden lockers, the lockers will made with security in
    mind as they are in an open public park and not inside an institution/
    business that could monitor theft. The design will be countered to be
    <i>‚Äúanti-crowbar‚Äù</i> so it can‚Äôt be easily forcibly pried open as well as
    <i>‚Äúanti-bolt cutter‚Äù</i> by having no need for a physical pad lock.

  <p>To phase out a pad lock I am thinking about using digital and
    electronic systems to lock and ensure the security of people‚Äôs items.
    Technology such as NFC in phones would prove to be crucial for this
    concept to be able to materialize. In tandem with individual city
    councils and or Parks Victoria I want to create an app that works to
    reserve certain sized lockers for certain times at a low as possible
    fee (Something like <b>$2</b> for every <b>30 minutes</b>) in addition the
    user would be able to select their own 6-digit pin remotely whilst
    reserving their locker.</p>

  <p>Having the locking mechanism being internal and mostly digital prevents
    attempts of physical theft, furthermore, being able to select the locker
    and unlock it through a separate console could counter some issues that
    could be associated with programming NFC on
    the phone to unlock the lockers.</p>

  <p>As I may have alluded to before, the lockers would come in multiple sizes
    (2 for now). The first size could be described as a ‚ÄúPigeonhole‚Äù, a nook
    that‚Äôs small and can only hold small valuables like watches, wallets etc‚Ä¶
    The second option would be able to house a conventional sports bag
    vertically, having enough room to house; bats, rackets and countless
    of other items. The pricing for each size hasn‚Äôt been conceptualised yet.</p>

  <p>When the person‚Äôs locker reservation is running out, they will be
    notified accordingly: When there‚Äôs 15 minutes remaining, the app will
    send a notification to the user‚Äôs device informing them of the time
    left. The second notification would occur at 5 minutes remaining and
    would act like the previous one. However, the difference is that it
    would be more audible and vibration heavy in order to gain the user‚Äôs
    attention and will instruct them to make their way to their locker and
    remove their items.</p>

  <p>If the user decides they want more time with the locker before, during or
    even just after their session, they will be able to select extended periods
    to add onto their existing time, having availability in mind of course.
    Someone‚Äôs extension will never override someone else‚Äôs booking if the are
    full, its only offered according to availability.</p>
  <br>

  <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
  <p>The software needed for this project would be one that work fast and
    without delays and hang-ups, as if there‚Äôs hick ups with the software or
    the program runs too slow people might have to wait for their items or
    even be completely unable to remove their items. There also must be
    decent security software, it can‚Äôt have random people being able to
    hijack the user‚Äôs account and information as well as disabling the
    locking mechanism.</p>

  <p>On the Hardware side of things, there would need to be computer components
    for the locker‚Äôs console as well as the locking mechanism which would most
    likely use strong magnets.</p>

  <p>I was also thinking of integrating a solar panel on top of the overhead
    shelter as it would aid in the systems being more sustainable.
    Not sure how much more efficient it would make this specific system <b>:|</b>
    .</p>
  <br>

  <h4>Skills Required</h4>
  <p>Programming NFC Tags, from what I can tell it isn‚Äôt the most complicated
    ordeal if I start of with just NFC tags on their own. There‚Äôs a lot of
    open-source websites that also give in-depth instructions on how to program
    NFC tags with just a phone! In terms of hardware skills, I will probably
    need to relearn soldering as that is an important skill if I‚Äôm making a
    small-scale model. From what I can see, acquiring all these skills is
    feasible granted I start small scale.</p>
  <br>

  <h4>Outcome</h4>
  <p>I want to start with a small scale ‚ÄúPigeonhole‚Äù prototype to see how well
    it works and if it does live up to my image. I don‚Äôt expect it to be an
    instant world problems fixer, but I hope over time I can grow the project
    to a point where it can be something we make second nature and don‚Äôt
    notice it. Especially with possible council funding and Parks VIC support
    it could be streamlined and more feasible to achieve the end goal.</p>
